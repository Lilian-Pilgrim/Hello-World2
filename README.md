# Hello-World2

I am Lilian Pilgrim. I want to spread the benefits of alternative therapy and there is no better place to do that than the web. 

So here I am learning how to code to make sure I can contribute to this world in more than one small way....

My file is called Hello-World2 because I just couldn't figure out how to find my first hello-world file I created.

As you can see, I have quite a bit to go before I can get the hang of this coding business....

I think I need the help of some Larch Bach Flower remedy to help me with the learning process of this new language.
